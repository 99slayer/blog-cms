# BLOG CMS
This is a content management system for TOP's blog project.

This simple CMS allows users to create new blog posts, update existing blog posts, publish and unpublish existing blog posts, and delete blog posts.

I made the project with plain html, css, and javascript. It had been awhile since I had worked without a framework and I wanted to brush up on some of the basics.
